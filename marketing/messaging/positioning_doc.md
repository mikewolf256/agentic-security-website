# Agentic Security Partners - Positioning Document

> **Last Updated:** December 2024  
> **Target Buyer:** CTO / VP Engineering at B2B SaaS (10-200 employees)  
> **Primary Offer:** 72-Hour Critical Triage → Monthly Validation Credits

## Category

**Validation-first security for web apps & APIs**

We're not a scanner. We're not a traditional pentest firm. We're the validation layer that turns scanner noise into actionable signal—delivered via a self-serve dashboard with human-verified findings.

---

## One-Liner

> **Turn scanner "critical" candidates into confirmed, reproducible findings (or confidently mark as false positives) and deliver an exec-ready view.**

**Shorter variant (for email subjects/LinkedIn):**
> We validate your scanner's "criticals" so engineering doesn't waste time on false positives.

---

## Three-Bullet Value Prop

1. **Every critical finding is human-validated** — We don't ship scanner output. Every high-severity candidate goes through multi-stage confirmation before it reaches your team.

2. **Evidence-backed, exec-ready deliverables** — Request/response proof, reproduction steps, and clear "confirmed / false positive" verdicts. No more "the tool said so" reports.

3. **Fast turnaround, transparent process** — 72-hour triage for urgent validations. Live dashboard shows candidate → confirmed workflow. You see exactly what we're doing.

## Target Market (ICP)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Company Type** | B2B SaaS with meaningful web app + API surface |
| **Size** | 10–200 employees |
| **Buyer** | CTO / VP Engineering |
| **Budget Authority** | Can approve $2.5k–$10k without lengthy procurement |

### Buyer Pains

- Scanner noise creating engineering churn ("we got 47 criticals, are any real?")
- Need to ship quickly without "security theater"
- Leadership wants clear answers: what is real, what must be fixed, by when
- Previous pentest reports were PDFs that sat in a drawer

### Strong Triggers

- SOC2/ISO prep (auditor asking for evidence)
- Upcoming product launch or funding round
- Post-incident ("we need to know what's actually vulnerable")
- "We're drowning in criticals" from existing scanner
- React/Next upgrade cycle (React2Shell concerns)

## Competitor Differentiation

### vs. Scanner-Only Tools (Snyk, Veracode, etc.)

| They Say | We Say |
|----------|--------|
| "50 critical findings detected" | "3 confirmed, 47 false positives closed with evidence" |
| Tool output PDF | Human-validated findings with reproduction steps |
| High noise, low trust | High signal, engineering trusts the results |

**Key message:** *"Scanners find candidates. We find vulnerabilities."*

### vs. Traditional Pentest Firms

| They Say | We Say |
|----------|--------|
| "2-4 week engagement" | "72-hour critical triage, full assessment in 3-5 days" |
| "$15k-$50k minimum" | "Start at $2.5k, scale based on scope" |
| "Report delivered at end" | "Live dashboard, findings as we go" |
| Variable coverage by tester | Consistent 40+ checks every time |

**Key message:** *"Pentest quality at automation speed."*

### vs. Bug Bounty Programs

| They Say | We Say |
|----------|--------|
| "Crowdsourced testing" | "Dedicated validation with your context" |
| Unpredictable timing/quality | Guaranteed turnaround and coverage |
| Public program management overhead | Private, scoped engagement |

**Key message:** *"Focused expertise, not a lottery."*

### vs. DIY (Burp + Freelancer)

| They Say | We Say |
|----------|--------|
| "We'll figure it out" | "We've automated discovery, you get validated findings" |
| Varies by who you hire | Consistent methodology, professional deliverables |
| No attestation | Signed attestation letter (Standard+) |

**Key message:** *"The expertise without the hiring risk."*

## Messaging by Buyer Pain

| Pain | Message |
|------|---------|
| "Scanner noise is killing us" | "We validate every critical before it reaches your team. When we report a vuln, it's real." |
| "We need SOC2 evidence" | "Signed attestation letter, audit-ready documentation, compliance mapping included." |
| "Pentests take too long" | "72-hour critical triage. Full assessment in 3-5 days, not 3-4 weeks." |
| "We don't trust the last report" | "Every finding includes reproduction steps. Your devs can verify in 5 minutes." |
| "Security is blocking releases" | "Clear verdicts mean engineering focuses on real issues, not chasing ghosts." |

---

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We already have a scanner" | "Great—we validate your scanner's output. We're the layer that turns candidates into confirmed findings." |
| "We just did a pentest" | "When was it? Attack surfaces change. We can run a quick delta assessment to catch what's new." |
| "It's too expensive" | "What's the cost of your team chasing 40 false positives? We start at $2.5k for rapid validation." |
| "We'll just do it ourselves" | "Your engineers' time is expensive. We give them validated, prioritized findings—not raw tool output." |
| "How do I know it's thorough?" | "Consistent OWASP Top 10 methodology, 40+ checks every time, plus human validation on all criticals." |

## Tagline Options

**Primary:**
> "AI-Powered Discovery. Human-Verified Findings."

**Alternatives:**
- "Autonomous Security Testing, Human-Grade Results"
- "Scanner noise → Actionable signal"
- "Your 24/7 Security Team"
- "We don't ship 'critical' without proof"

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

> "Agentic Security validates your scanner's 'critical' findings so your team doesn't waste time on false positives. We combine AI-powered discovery with human validation—every critical finding is manually verified before it reaches your report. You get evidence-backed findings, not tool output. Most clients see 60-80% of their 'criticals' closed as false positives, with the real vulnerabilities clearly documented with reproduction steps. We can turn around a critical triage in 72 hours."
